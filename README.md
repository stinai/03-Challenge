Completed Random Generated Password (JavaScript)

Updated a starter code in Javascript. 

The code originally only showed the css and html but had no function of Javascript. 

I added an event listener to have a function for the button. 

I added functions to allow the password to be randomly generated. 
With the use of primative types.
